# EMG-Microcontroller
This code uses the Arduino 101 IMU sensors as well as an EMG signal amplifier in order to use those signals as controls for the microcontroller. This basic microcontroller is a very simple prototype for building prosthese for amputees, who can still send EMG signals to control an application of daily life: in this case, a video game. The code given uses gyroscope readings and EMG signal readings by using power estimation.
